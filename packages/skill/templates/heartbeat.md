## Zettelclaw Vault Maintenance

- [ ] Triage `00 Inbox/` — process captures into proper notes or discard
- [ ] Check for notes missing links — `obsidian orphans` / `obsidian unresolved`
- [ ] Review recent journal entries for insights worth extracting into standalone notes
- [ ] Update project notes with progress from recent conversations
- [ ] Update MEMORY.md with anything worth keeping in working memory
