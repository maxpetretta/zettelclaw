## Zettelclaw Vault Maintenance

- [ ] Review recent journal session sections (`Done` / `Decisions` / `Facts` / `Open`)
- [ ] Synthesize durable concepts into evergreen notes in `00 Inbox/` (agent-created heartbeat notes stay in inbox)
- [ ] Check for notes missing links — `obsidian orphans` / `obsidian unresolved`
- [ ] Retro-link journal entries with `[[wikilinks]]` (hook output is intentionally link-free)
- [ ] Capture project/research drift as inbox handoff notes for human review
- [ ] Update MEMORY.md with anything worth keeping in working memory
- [ ] Leave inbox items ready for human promotion into `01 Notes/`
