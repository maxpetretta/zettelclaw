# Welcome to your Zettelclaw vault

This is your knowledge base. Here's how it's organized:

- **Inbox/** — drop quick captures here, triage them later
- **Daily/** — daily notes (one per day, auto-created via template)
- **Notes/** — everything else: ideas, projects, research, contacts, writing
- **Templates/** — note templates (used automatically when creating new notes)

## Getting started

Create your first note in `Notes/` using one of the templates. Each note type has its own frontmatter — the templates handle this for you.
