# Welcome to your Zettelclaw vault

This is your knowledge base. Here's how it's organized:

- **00 Inbox/** — drop quick captures here, triage them later
- **01 Notes/** — everything else: ideas, projects, research, contacts, writing
- **02 Agent/** — OpenClaw symlinks (only present when OpenClaw integration is enabled)
- **03 Journal/** — journal notes (one per day, auto-created via template)
- **04 Templates/** — note templates (used automatically when creating new notes)
- **05 Attachments/** — files and media assets

If OpenClaw integration is disabled, `02 Agent/` is omitted and numbering is compacted to `02 Journal/`, `03 Templates/`, and `04 Attachments/`.

## Getting started

Create your first note in `01 Notes/` using one of the templates. Each note type has its own frontmatter — the templates handle this for you.
