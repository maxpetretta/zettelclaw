### 🔄 Vault Maintenance (During Heartbeats)

Periodically (every few days), use a heartbeat to maintain the vault:

1. **Triage Inbox** — Read `00 Inbox/` items, extract into proper notes or discard
2. **Surface orphans** — Find notes with no incoming links (`obsidian orphans`) and link them
3. **Fix unresolved links** — Check `obsidian unresolved` and create notes for important missing targets
4. **Update MEMORY.md** — Review recent vault notes, update your hot cache with what matters
5. **Clean up** — Archive completed projects (`status: archived`), check for stale research

The vault is your memory. Keep it healthy.
