# Zettelclaw 🦞

A human+agent knowledge system built on Obsidian and OpenClaw.

Zettelclaw sets up an Obsidian vault designed for dual human+agent authorship — atomic notes, rich linking, frontmatter as API, and automated extraction from conversations to durable knowledge.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx zettelclaw init
# or
bunx zettelclaw init
```

The wizard asks for a vault path and sync method, then auto-configures everything: templates, plugins, and OpenClaw integration (if detected).

For a fully non-interactive setup:

```bash
npx zettelclaw init --yes --vault ~/my-vault
```

## What It Does

- Creates a ready-to-use Obsidian vault with 6 note templates (daily, note, project, research, contact, writing)
- Configures community plugins (Templater, Linter, Obsidian Git)
- Auto-detects OpenClaw and creates Agent/ symlinks + workspace injection
- Sets up frontmatter-driven note types that both humans and AI agents can read/write
